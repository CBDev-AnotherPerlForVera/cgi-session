This is a working collaborative TODO list. Please keep it up to date as you see
fit. In the short term, let's focus on what it takes to make a solid 4.0
release!

[COMPATIBILITY]

 - What else? 

[TEST COVERAGE]
 - All existing tests need to pass. 

[INTERNALS]

 - Make the code easier to follow by moving subroutines
   next to their documentation. That allows you to confirm
   at a glance that the code and documentation for a routine
   match, and keep them in sync easier. 

[ MISSING FEATURES / WISHLIST ] 

 - etime() needs an alias, because it's not a time at all, it's a interval.
   I recommend duration().
   

 - Allow CGI::Session->new( $dbh );
   This syntax would automatically figure out the CGI::Session driver name
   based on the DBI driver. This can't work in every case because there is
   not a 1-to-1 correspondence. For example, the PureSQL driver is an alternate
   database backend. Still, because it can address the common cases with MySQL
   and PostgreSQL drivers, it seems worthwhile.
