This is a working collaborative TODO list. Please keep it up to date as you see
fit. In the short term, let's focus on what it takes to make a solid 4.0
release!

[COMPATIBILITY]

 - close() existed in 3.x, but has no code, tests or documentation in 4.x yet.
   See also:
   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7169823&forum_id=17960

 - $CGI::Session::File::FileName = 'cgisession_%s.txt' was documented to work in 3.x,
   but needs code test and docs for 4.x

[TEST COVERAGE]
 - All existing tests need to pass. 

 - expire() needs more test. Right now we just test:
    - expire()
    - expire('+10m');
    - expire('1s');

[INTERNALS]

 - Make the code easier to follow by moving subroutines
   next to their documentation. That allows you to confirm
   at a glance that the code and documentation for a routine
   match, and keep them in sync easier. 

[ MISSING FEATURES / WISHLIST ] 

 - Allow CGI::Session->new( $dbh );
   This syntax would automatically figure out the CGI::Session driver name
   based on the DBI driver. This can't work in every case because there is
   not a 1-to-1 correspondence. For example, the PureSQL driver is an alternate
   database backend. Still, becaues it can address the common cases with MySQL
   and PostgreSQL drivers, it seems worthwhile.
